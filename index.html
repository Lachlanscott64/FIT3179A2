            <div>
                <p>We can see that most players tend to come from Europe or North and South America, this makes sense as this is where Counter-Strike is most popular. </p>

                <br>

                <p>The reason there is so few players in Asia despite gaming being very popular there, is due to the face 
                    that First Person Shooter (FPS) games arent as popular there compared to other genres, as such Counter-Strike never really took off in that region.

            <div>
                <p>The country that has the most players is the USA, this is because the vast majority of players from the North American region are from the USA
                    while the larger region (Europe) has its players spread out over alot more countries. 
                </p>

                <br>
                <br>

                <p>Denmark is the second most popular country in terms of the amount of players, Denmark is very notorious for having a very large amount of players that are some of the best in the world. </p>

                <br>

                <p>Most of the players towards the top of the amount of maps played have been in the professional scene for a really long time, some of them have been playing Counter-Strike for more than a decade.</p>

        <h2>Who is the best player?</h2>

            <div>
                <p>The best player is a tough thing to determine, while we can look at stats alone, they can often be misleading or not tell the whole story. 
                    However, they can definitley be a good indicator of how good a player likely is.
                </p>

                <p>If we look at stats alone, we can see two players who seem to stand out quite a bit. Zyw0o and s1mple, these two both appear in the top 5 of all the relevant stats, rating, impact score and kd/ratio.
                    These two are commonly considered as some of, if not the best players in the world.
                </p>

                <p class="subheading">But what is rating and impact score?</p>

                <p>Rating is a measure of how well a player plays on average, it is calculated using multiple variables that are measured each round. Impact score is a meausure of how many kills a player gets every round, and how much they will "impact" the average round</p>

                <p>Most players tend to sit at a very similar kill/death ratio and also tend to get around the same number of kills each round, however, as we can see, there are a few outliers,
                    with quite a few players being much better than the rest of their competition. </p>
